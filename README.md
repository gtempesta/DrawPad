# Tutorial of "How To Make A Simple Drawing App with UIKit and Swift"

From the website [raywenderlich.com](raywenderlich.com), an updated version of the tutorial [How To Make A Simple Drawing App with UIKit and Swift](https://www.raywenderlich.com/1934-how-to-make-a-simple-drawing-app-with-uikit-and-swift).  

While trying to make it work in Swift 3, I have found this repo with a full-working update, from which I have drawn examples on how to translate some parts of the code to the new version of the language: [https://github.com/dragosholban/DrawPad](https://github.com/dragosholban/DrawPad). 

This version works fine with Swift 4.2, anyway just before publishing my version of the tutorial I have discovered a more advanced version here: [UIKit Drawing Tutorial: How to Make a Simple Drawing App](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5895-uikit-drawing-tutorial-how-to-make-a-simple-drawing-app).
